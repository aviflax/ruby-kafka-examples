# Ruby+Kafka Examples

Examples of working with Ruby+Kafka, initially by [Avi Flax](http://aviflax.com/).

Please note: these examples were originally developed in order to be presented live as part of a tech talk. As such thereâ€™s little to no written background information or explanation of jargon. If you think those should be added, please open an issue to suggest that.

Please post any and all questions, comments, concerns, suggestions, or any feedback at all as an issue. Thanks!
